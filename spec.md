Inspired by Terra Invicta Space Battles.

Goald generate  a space battle enviroment where two realistic near future ships are enganging other a station we will not render here. The defender is trying to destroy the ship or disable it. The attacker is either trying to destroy the ship or disengage of the defender which would then allow it to reach the station before the defender. 

What i would like to have is both ships be controlled by LLM Agents with different models. Each ship should have an captain, weapons officer and helmsman. Each caracter is the own agent. So captain , weapons officer and helmsmann would get their own possible actions, and captain would decide what actions to be done. 

My idea is to have all the backend calculation to be done via Python uv, and maybe provide the some kind of visualisation. 

We want 3d Space, and Physics based movement, so Newtonian movement, each ship has RCS thrusters, a very advanced drive with some vector thrust, battery, a suitable reactor for the drive, a heatsink and thermal radiotors which can be tugged in for close combat situations. Both ships should be at first identical. Weapons should be some magnetic coil turrets up and down with three tubes each. 2 point defense lasers, a big spinal coil weapon shooting big slugs away and two torpedo launchers. For the torpedoes assume some near future drive so they should have more than 10 kilometers per second delta v and more than 6 g accelearation. The slugs as well as torpedoes can be shot down by point defense, alithough the spinal coil turret takes a lot of time. Each ship should have a battery, because during accellaration the reactor is not giving enough power for the drive and electric systems, so when firing during movements energy is takinkg from the battery. each weapon system aside from torpedoes have their own small batteries and drawrate of power, as the laser shots and magnetic coil shots take a lot instant power. We give the ships welll above 700 km/s delta v and max combat acceleration of 4 g ( some kind of fusion drives). Each ship should have armour. We simplify the model to have an armor rating for front side and rear. where the front has the most armour, side less and rear even less. We really need to think about the damage model. If a weapon penerates the hull and damages the interior. Lets say every ship consists out of three modules. a ship is distroyed if all modules have 0 hp. some weapone have enough damage to penetrate through multiple modules. Any damage to a module has a percentage chance to disable a hardpoint until the module is destroyed where each hardpoints attached to it are disabled. Also since I mentioned heatsink and thermal radiator. we need to modell the heat of the ship ( simple number). Since drive is not 100 % efficient ( almost but the lucdriocus amount of power still generates a alot of heat) the reactor produces heat and each weapen system generates heat. If the heatmeter is 100 % the ship is distroyed

First task would be to think about this problem ask as many questions as possible, and formulate some architecutre ideas toghether with me in multiple md files

Maybe have some agents look through "D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Terra Invicta" to get some code or some values for exotic drives etc
